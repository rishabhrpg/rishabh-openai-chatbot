This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys for the AI providers you intend to use:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   AMAZON_API_KEY=your_amazon_api_key_here
   ```
